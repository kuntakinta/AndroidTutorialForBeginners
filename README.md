In order to test with espresso test framework i forked github repository
https://github.com/hussien89aa/AndroidTutorialForBeginners.

I have created two simple tests on application Alaram App under directory:
/Alaram App/app/src/androidTest.

First of the scenarios is checking whether desired pop-up is displayed. It is confirmed
by checking the text which should be displayed on pop-up.
Second scenario checks if user is correctly navigated onto main activity view after closing pop-up
with button "done". It verifies if text which should be located on Main Activity View is displayed.
